        <p>Welcome to my... <i>(tries to remember)</i> ... third personal website (fourth if you count the website builder one from forever ago). Lol idk what to put here go use the <a href="https://scanuproductions.com/spear.html">Shakespeare Translator</a> or something. Or you could just waste 45 minutes looking at the nav bar gradients I guess. Gradients are a lot like gold paint, they can really make a website or icon when used subtly or for small detains, but too much just looks dumb. Blur, on the other hand, can never be overused. Also yes, I know some of the gallery images repeat if you put the website on one-half of the screen. Some are 4:3 and some are 16:9 (because middle-school age me was an idiot who messed around with the settings on my camera), but removing any would result in having to rename all the files which I really don't feel like doing. Seriously why are you still reading this go click on a link already.</p>
