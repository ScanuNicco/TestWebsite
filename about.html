        	<p>I am a member of the Scotbotics, a First Tech Challenge robotics team in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Java; and I can also get by in Python and (less so) in C++. I love computers, and I've even built two gaming PCs. Just about every computer I can get my hands on has some form of KDE installed, even my phone! I also love 3D printing, and I use my 3D printer for all kinds of projects from my car to model railroading. Outside of the tech world I also love skiing, hiking, dogs, and video games.</p>
