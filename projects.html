				<h2>Car Computer</h2> 
				<p>My newest project... Raspberry Pi in a car!. I know it's been done before but I wanted to take a shot at it using parts I already had. The car computer is made out of 3D printed parts and sits in the top portion of a double-DIN radio slot. To reduce complexity and cost, the car computer is simply connected to my exsisting aftermarket radio with an aux cable, meaning that I didn't have to re-implement features of a regular radio such as tuning or bluetooth calling. On the front is a 4.3" touchscreen salvaged from an old HP printer, two USB ports for adding music and debugging, and some buttons for navigation. Internally everything is powered by a Raspberry Pi 2 running linux with the i3 tiling window manager and a custom electron-based music player. In addition to playing music, the car computer is connected to a USB webcam via a very long extension cable to serve as a backup camera.</p>
